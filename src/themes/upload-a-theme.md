  - **author** - The name of the author of the theme. `[REQUIRED]`
  - **description** - Short paragraph describing the content and/or purpose of the theme that will appear in the permalink of your page and other places on the site. `[REQUIRED]`
  - **download** - The direct link to the file to be downloaded. This can be the direct link to the file on a open-source website like [Github](https://github.com/). `[REQUIRED]`
  - **github\_profile\_url** - The link to your [Github](https://github.com/) profile.`[OPTIONAL]`
  >You can use **gitlab\_profile\_url** or **npm\_profile\_url** instead (or all) and same goes for the source url
  - **github\_source\_url** - For open-source themes, this URL points to the repo that powers the theme `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **support** - A link to allow people to get support. (In most cases it should be the [Github issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) url) `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **discord\_server** - A Discord server invite to allow people to get support or give feedback for the theme. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **demo** - This is a direct url to the file so the [demo](https://betterdocs.netlify.com/demo/dark.html?theme=INSERT-URL-HERE) can work. For Github it need's to be the **raw** url but to fix the MIME type issue you will need to use [githack](https://raw.githack.com) for the url instead (or https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh). `[OPTIONAL]`

  - **status** - Values: `Updated/Oudated`. The current status of your theme.
  - **featured** - Values `True/False`. Remove entirely or leave as false. Only used for featured themes that are chosen.
  - **auto** - If your theme is hosted on [Github](https://github.com) then add `true` to allow users to automatically down the file (or even the entire repo) instead of just' visiting the site, if hosted elsewhere leave blank or remove it entirely. `[REQUIRED]`
  - **style** - Values: `dark/light`. This specifies the setting for the [demo](https://betterdocs.us). `[REQUIRED (if using demo)]`
  - **tags** - Tags are in an array and can be seperated with commas "," like so `[tag1,tag2]`. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **ghcommentid** - ~~The ID of the issue related to your theme so it can be used in our comments system~~. `[REQUIRED]` 
  - **layout** - Used by the [Jekyll](https://github.com//MrRobotjs/BetterDocs/) version of this website. `[REQUIRED]` 

### How to set as Featured
*Note: the BetterDocs team will choose featured themes, leave as `featured: false` when first posting or remove entirely instead.*

  1. If your theme is chosen as featured, hereâ€™s what to do next:

  2. Change `featured: false` to `featured: true` or if it doesn't exist yet then add it.
